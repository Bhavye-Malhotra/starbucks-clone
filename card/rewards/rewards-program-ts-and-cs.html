There are multiple ways to enroll in My Starbucks Rewards™ and begin accumulating Stars:</p><ol><li><p>If you have a physical Starbucks Card, or Starbucks eCard, visit  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in">rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in</a>. Follow the prompts to create an account and register at least one (1) activated Starbucks Card, or Starbucks eCard. “Activation” means that you have loaded a minimum of INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred only) onto your Starbucks Card for the first time. The minimum balance required to activate a Starbucks Card, or Starbucks eCard INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only).</p></li><li><p>Download the Starbucks India mobile app to your Android or iPhone device. Follow the prompts to create an account and register with a Starbucks Card or Starbucks eCard.</p></li></ol><p>The registration process may require that you provide the following information using the online registration form: username, password, email address (required in order to receive all eligible Rewards), Starbucks Card number or Starbucks eCard number, and card security code (CSC), birthday month, name, and postal address, contact number, etc. All of your Starbucks Cards and Starbucks eCards activated in India can be registered for use in My Starbucks Rewards™ under these Terms and Conditions. For ease of reference, in these Terms and Conditions, the term “Starbucks Card” refers to a Starbucks Card – physical or digital/virtual (Starbucks eCard) – that may be activated in India only, either online or at a Starbucks store in India, and the term “activated, registered Starbucks Card” refers to a Starbucks Card that has been activated in India only with an initial card load amount of INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only) and registered to your Starbucks Card account at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in">rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in</a> or on the Starbucks India mobile app.</p><p>My Starbucks Rewards™ benefits are determined based on the amount you spend at any Starbucks store in India and the number of "Stars" that you earn through spending with your registered Starbucks Card(s). A "Star" for purposes of My Starbucks Rewards™ means each time you use your registered Starbucks Card to pay for a purchase worth INR 300 (Rupees Three Hundred Only, incl. of taxes) on any food, beverage, merchandise, Ready to Drink (for example- juices, water, etc.) and Ready To Eat (for example packaged foods like chocolates, almonds, cashews etc.) at a Starbucks store in India. No "Star" will be rewarded for purchases made with a registered Starbucks Card in any Starbucks store outside India. For each qualified purchase, you will receive one (1) “Star” for any purchase worth INR 300 (Rupees Three Hundred only, inclusive of all taxes), at any Starbucks store in India, except during limited time promotions when Starbucks may offer "Bonus Stars" on featured products and/or services. Stars are for promotional purposes only and have no cash value. You can use any registered Starbucks Card to earn Stars for your spending at Starbucks stores in India. Please note that a member can only earn Stars accumulated after the activated Starbucks Card is registered at <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in">rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in</a>. You can manage your account online at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in">rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in</a> or through the Starbucks India mobile app. You can track your rewards by signing into your account at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/">rewards.starbucks.in</a> or <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in">rewards.starbucks.in/sign-in</a> or on the Starbucks India mobile app.</p><h3>My Starbucks Rewards™ Levels</h3><p>Currently, there are three (3) levels in My Starbucks Rewards™ which are determined by the number of Stars that you accumulate in your account in a 12 month period. By creating an account, activating and registering a Starbucks Card, you will be automatically enrolled in My Starbucks Rewards™ at the Welcome Level. Earn at least five (5) Stars within the twelve (12) month period following the date you reach Welcome level and you will advance to the Green Level. If you earn at least twenty (20) Stars within the 12-month period following the date you reach Green level, you will qualify for the Gold Level.</p><p>Once you reach a specific Level within My Starbucks Rewards™, you will receive the benefits that are applicable to that Level only. However, you must continue to accumulate Stars in order to maintain your level:</p><ol><li>To maintain the Welcome Level, you must earn at least one (1) new Star during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reach Welcome level. If you do not obtain one (1) new Star in 12 months from the enrolment date, you will no longer be eligible for the Welcome Level benefits of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your Star balance will be reset to zero.
<br /><br />
If you earn less than one (1) star in your 12 month anniversary period, you will not receive Welcome level benefits till the time you earn one (1) Star again.
<br /><br />
At the Welcome level, if you earn five (5) to twenty four (24) stars in your 12 month anniversary period you will be placed at the Green level, and if you earn twenty five (25) stars in your 12 month anniversary period you will be placed at the Gold level.</li><li>To maintain the Green Level, you must earn at least five (5) new Stars during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reached the Green Level. If you do not obtain 5 new Stars in 12-months, you will be placed at the Welcome Level of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your Star balance will be reset to zero.
<br /><br />
At the Green level, If you earn less than or equal to four (4) stars in your 12 month anniversary period, you will be placed at the Welcome level.
<br /><br />
At the Green level, if you earn twenty (20) stars in your 12 month anniversary period you will be placed at the Gold level.</li><li>To maintain the Gold Level, you must earn at least twenty five (25) new Stars during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reached the Gold Level. If you do not obtain 25 new Stars in that 12-month period, you will be placed at the Green Level of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your Star balance will be reset to zero.
<br /><br />
At the Gold level, if you earn less than twenty five (25) stars in your 12 month anniversary you will be placed at the Green level.</li></ol><p><strong>Please note that "Stars" accumulated for each level will only be valid for twelve (12) months from the date you reach the particular level.</strong>For example: You activate a Starbucks Card at a Starbucks store in India on 2nd May 2013 by loading INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only) onto the Starbucks Card. You register that Starbucks Card on 1st June 2013. Your spending will only be considered as a qualified purchase from 1st June 2013 and this is the date from when you can start earning Stars. If you earn twenty five (25) Stars on 15th June 2013, you will be placed on Gold Level and entitled to Gold Level benefits and your entitlement to Gold Level benefits will expire on 14th June 2014. On 15th June 2014, your Star balance will reset to zero and you will be placed at Gold level.</p><p>If you have accumulated twenty five (25) new Stars between 15th June 2014 and 14th June 2015 earning the required number of Stars to maintain your Gold Level, you will automatically be placed at Gold Level and entitled to the various Gold Level benefits for the 12-month period between 15th June 2015 and 14th June 2016, and your Star balance will be zero on your requalifying date. Your account will be updated within 24 hours of a level change or maintaining your level and you will be informed by email or through a Mobile Inbox message on the Starbucks India mobile app when you move to the next level or move down from a particular level.</p><h3>Welcome Level</h3><p>By opening an account, activating and registering your Starbucks Card, you automatically enter into the “Welcome Level” of My Starbucks Rewards™.
